### Things to do to complete `signed`, ~~mid-October 2020~~ late-May 2021

[x] Rework list/list_eg/list_mod into canonical list
[x] Create signed versions of spec, type, ns, errors
  [x] spec
  [x] type
  [x] ns
  [x] errors
[-] Write refs
  [x] Draft refs
  [x] Update refs for new ludus scheme
[-] Develop `method` scheme
  [x] Hand code a few methods
  [x] Find my abstractions
  [x] Draft base implementation
  [x] Write protocols
    [ ] consider moving protocols into Spec
  [?] Determine next steps
    [*] consider moving methods into `base`: `show` wants to be a method
[-] Complete ducers
  [ ] TODOs are in file
[ ] pull out TODOs from everywhere into a list

[?] Some lazy fns should be ducers (maybe)
[ ] Start writing tests (ugh)
